We've had another couple of minor changes to make as a result of version 1.7, so a new minor version has been submitted to AppSource, to assist affected users. You can view what's included in the [Change Log](/docs/changelog).

The [standalone version](/docs/getting-started#standalone-version) has already been published for anyone who wants to take advantage of this. As usual, the AppSource version takes a little longer to go through the certification process, but we expect this to be available within the normal timeline of a few weeks. I will provide an update on its status as soon as I can.

Thanks, as always,
