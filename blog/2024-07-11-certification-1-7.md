It should take around two weeks for the new version to fully deploy to your reports. In the meantime, you can see the full list of changes in the [Change Log](/docs/changelog). This has also been made available for users of the standalone (non-AppSource) version, so you can [download it from GitHub](https://deneb.link/latest-release).

To help AppSource users with the wait, we've recorded some short videos to help you get to know the new features and will be releasing a new one each day. The first feature we're showcasing is dark mode ðŸŒ™ But we'll add new videos to the playlist below, so keep checking or like and subscribe (if that's your thing) to stay current.
