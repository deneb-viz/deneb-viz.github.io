# Declarative Visualization in Power BI

> _**Deneb is currently in beta** and lots of things are still being actively developed. This site is under construction and the information in this page may be subject to frequent change, so please check often to ensure that you're up-to-date._

Deneb is a custom visual for <OutboundLink href="https://www.powerbi.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Power BI</OutboundLink>, which allows developers to use the declarative <OutboundLink href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank">JSON</OutboundLink> syntax of the <OutboundLink href="http://vega.github.io/vega" target="_blank">Vega</OutboundLink> or <OutboundLink href="http://vega.github.io/vega-lite" target="_blank">Vega-Lite</OutboundLink> languages to create their own data visualizations.

This is similar to the approaches used for creating <OutboundLink href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-r-visuals?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003712" target="_blank">R</OutboundLink> and <OutboundLink href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-python-visuals?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003712" target="_blank">Python</OutboundLink> visuals in Power BI, with the following additional benefits:

-   Libraries are packaged with the visual, so no additional dependencies on local libraries or gateways for your end-users when publishing reports.
-   Specifications are rendered inside the Power BI client, rather than being delegated to another location, typically resulting in faster render times for end-users.
-   Built for the web, meaning that it's possible to integrate with Power BI's interactivity features, with some additional setup. [Tooltips](interactivity-tooltips) are currently supported, and other features are on the roadmap.
