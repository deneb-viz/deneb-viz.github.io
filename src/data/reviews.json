I started with vega-lite and then moved onto vega as I wanted more freedom.  This is the power user's final fantasy, I wish the power bi team would give it some love and integrate it directly with power bi.  My utmost wish is that the power bi team allow deneb to load multiple datasets instead of just one as it is such a pain to have to combine datasets into a single dataset all the time.  Also that the power bi team allow more freedom to sharing signals.  With these two things power bi would become a awesome tool as well as a popular tool.",
