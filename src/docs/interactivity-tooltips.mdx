We saw [in the worked example](simple-worked-example#adding-tooltips), that it's fairly straightforward to add tooltips to a specification, but we'll unpack on this page in a bit more detail.

If you haven't read it already, it's worth reviewing the [preceding page](interactivity-features-overview) to understand some of the considerations that need to be made with integrating back to Power BI. It will certainly help with understanding the logistics around report page tooltips in particular.

## Tooltip Strategy

Both <OutboundLink href="https://github.com/vega/vega-tooltip/blob/master/docs/creating_your_tooltip.md#step-4-define-your-tooltip-in-vega-or-vega-lite" target="_blank">Vega</OutboundLink> and <OutboundLink href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/tooltip.html" target="_blank">Vega-Lite</OutboundLink> both provide the ability to customize how their tooltip events can be interpreted. Deneb contains a tooltip handler writen specifically for Power BI, which will display under the following conditions:

1. **Tooltip Handler** is enabled in the _Vega > Power BI Interactivity_ section of the [Settings pane in the Visual editor](visual-editor#settings-tab). This is currently enabled by default.

2. An appropriate `tooltip` property is assigned to a mark. Refer [below](#vega-lite-syntax) for the recommended syntax for each provider.

3. A tooltip-enabled mark is hovered over.

## Data Point Resolution

Provided that your mark's datum is not transformed or mutated away from the `"values"` dataset and represents the _"pure"_ row context passed-in, Deneb can resolve this back to Power BI for delegation.

If a report page exists with at least one of the columns in the current datum, then Power BI will display it for the current row context, e.g.:

![tooltip-report-page-example.png](/images/interactivity/tooltip-report-page-example.png "Deneb resolving a mark's datum back to a report page tooltip.")

If there is no suitable report page for the current datum or you have specified a default tooltip in the _Tooltip_ menu in Power BI's _Properties_ pane, then a default tooltip will be displayed, e.g.:

![tooltip-default-example.png](/images/interactivity/tooltip-default-example.png "Deneb resolving a mark's datum back to a default tooltip.")

> _A default tooltip will display all values for the current mark's datum, including any other columns or measures bound to its particular row context._

## Default Tooltip Styling

This is done in the usual way, i.e. in the _Tooltip_ menu in Power BI's properties pane.

## Vega-Lite Syntax

The <OutboundLink href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/tooltip.html#encoding" target="_blank">simplest approach for this</OutboundLink> is recommended, e.g.:

```json
{
    ...
        "mark": {
            ...
            "tooltip": true,
            ...
        },
    ...
}
```

## Vega Syntax

With Vega, you need to specify the `tooltip` signal in your mark's `encode` property, e.g.:

```json
{
    ...
    "encode": {
        "enter": {
            ...
            "tooltip": {
                "signal": "datum"
            },
            ...
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

## Limitations and Considerations

-   It's been mentioned countless times already, but tooltip integration with Power BI is wholy dependent on the correct row context. [Refer above](#data-point-resolution), or to the [Overview](interactivity-features-overview) page for more information about ensuring this is preserved.

-   Adding a tooltip does not automatically add visual feedback or effects. If you want to track the position of the resolved data point more visually (e.g. like for a line chart), you will need to add a suitable set of marks to do this. Both <OutboundLink href="https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/" target="_blank">Vega</OutboundLink> and <OutboundLink href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/" target="_blank">Vega-Lite</OutboundLink> have examples you can refer to.

-   Development so far has been focused on Power BI integration. It's possible that if you deviate from the above patterns, then tooltips may not display correctly. If you find any such use cases, please <OutboundLink href="https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb-powerbi/issues" target="_blank">create an issue</OutboundLink> with the appropriate reproduction steps (e.g. example specification and/or data) and we'll see what we can do about it.
