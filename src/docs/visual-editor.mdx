> _**Deneb is currently in beta** and lots of things are still being actively developed. This site is under construction and the information in this page may be subject to frequent change, so please check often to ensure that you're up-to-date._

The Visual Editor is used to define your specification, configuration and any other options.

## Opening the Editor

The Visual Editor is only available when your report is in edit mode, that is, when you're editing in Power BI Desktop or in the Service. If the report is being viewed in the Power BI Service or other application, then it is not eligible for editing and any such options will be unavailable to your end-users.

To use the editor, your visual first needs some data, so please ensure that you have added any appropriate columns or measures to the _Values_ data role.

Once data has been provided, the Visual Editor is accessed by selecting the visual header (...) and then _Edit_, e.g.:

![opening-editor.png](/images/getting-started/opening-editor.png "We can access the Visual Editor by selecting 'Edit' from the Visual Header.")

This will put the visual into focus mode.

## Finding your Way Around

The Visual Editor pane will be on the left and your rendered specification will be shown to the right, e.g.:

![editor-interface-overview.png](/images/editor/editor-interface-overview.png "Overview of Deneb in focus mode, showing the editing interface.")

> _We're showing a pre-built specification here; if this is your first time opening the editor in a new visual, then the New Specification dialog will be visible, to help you get started. Refer to the [Simple Worked Example](/simple-worked-example) page for an example of this functionality, or the [New Specification](#new-specification) section below for more details._

### The Visual Editor Pane

The _Visual Editor_ pane is used to carry out any operations in this screen:

-   It can be collapsed and expanded, much like the other panes in Power BI, which can be useful for previewing designs.
-   The pane can be resized to use a maximum of 60% of the visible canvas by click-dragging.
-   Double-clicking the resizer will revert the pane to its default size (40% of the visible canvas).

### The Command Bar

![command-bar.png](/images/editor/command-bar.png "The Command Bar in the Visual Editor pane.")

The Command Bar contains the following operations (from left to right):

#### Apply

_Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Command + Enter`_

-   Selecting this option will apply any changes you have made in either the _Specification_ or _Config_ and update your visual.
-   This option is disabled if you have _Auto-Apply_ enabled (see below).

> _If you exit focus mode (and out of the Visual Editor) **any unapplied changes may not be saved**, so please ensure that you apply changes before returning to the standard view._

#### Toggle Auto-Apply

_Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Command + Shift + Enter`_

-   Selecting this option will apply changes to the _Specification_ or _Config_ editors as you type them.
-   Enabling this option will disable the _Apply_ command.

> _Whilst this option is convenient for seeing changes take effect immediately, it can have negative performance implications if you're working with a large number of data points or elements within your visualization. Please refer to the [Performance Considerations](/performance-considerations) page for further details on potential risks and mitigation approaches._

#### Repair and Format JSON

_Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Command + \`_

-   Selecting this option will attempt to repair any simple typographical issues in your JSON, and re-format it with indentation.
-   The tooling does its best to fix anything straightforward but in some cases it will not be possible to repair the JSON and manual corrections may be required and a banner will be shown above the editor.
-   In these cases, you can select the error details in the bottom-right to investigate further and use this information to correct, e.g.:
    ![editor-repair-error.gif](/images/editor/editor-repair-error.gif "Animated illustration of correcting a JSON error manually using the information in the editor.")

#### New Specification

_Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Command + Alt + N`_

-   Selecting this option will open the _Create New Specification_ dialog.
-   The dialog can be used to replace the current Specification and Config with either an bare-minimum set of JSON for each, or you can choose from a number of simple templates to get started.
-   Templates are currently packaged in with the visual and it's not yet possible to import them, although hopefully this will be something we can work on bringing in later on.

> _This dialog is also diplayed by default if this is the first time opening the Visual Editor for any new instance of Deneb that you add to the report canvas._

#### Help

_Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Command + Alt + H`_

-   Selecting this option will cause Power BI to confirm you wish to open the link to this documentation site. Selecting _OK_ will open it in a new browser tab.

### Specification Editor Tab

-   This tab contains an editor that you can use to enter and amend your specification's JSON as desired.
    -   The Vega JSON specification reference <OutboundLink href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/" target="_blank">can be found here</OutboundLink>.
    -   The Vega-Lite JSON specification reference <OutboundLink href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/spec.html" target="_blank">can be found here</OutboundLink>.
-   To view the results of your changes, you can either _[Apply](#apply)_ your changes, or ensure that _[Auto-Apply](#toggle-auto-apply)_ is enabled.
-   The JSON must produce a valid specification for your selected provider (either Vega or Vega-Lite).
-   The editor will perform validation against the schema for the specificed provider and warnings are displayed that you can inspect, e.g.:
    ![schema-validation-example.png](/images/editor/schema-validation-example.png "Example of a schema validation issue for an invalid Vega-Lite mark type.")

### Config Editor Tab

-   This tab contains an editor that you can use to enter and amend any JSON you wish to add for your visual's config as desired.
    -   The Vega JSON config reference <OutboundLink href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/config/" target="_blank">can be found here</OutboundLink>.
    -   The Vega-Lite JSON config reference <OutboundLink href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/config.html" target="_blank">can be found here</OutboundLink>.
-   To view the results of your changes, you can either _[Apply](#apply)_ your changes, or ensure that _[Auto-Apply](#toggle-auto-apply)_ is enabled.
-   The JSON must produce a valid config for your selected provider (either Vega or Vega-Lite).
-   It's generally advised to try and use the config for anything that can "theme" your chart and keep this separate from the specification. This makes easier to port across to other instances of the visual, e.g.:
    ![config-example.png](/images/editor/config-example.png "Example of a config for a Vega-Lite visual.")

> _You can choose to add your config to a top-level `"config": {}` object in the **Specification** tab, if you so wish._

### Settings Tab

-   This tab is used to configure specific behavior of Deneb when generating output:
    ![settings-tab.png](/images/editor/settings-tab.png "The settings tab, which is used to configure aspects of Deneb's behavior.")
-   The _Provider_ allows you to specify whether to use Vega or Vega-Lite for your _Specification_ and _Config_.
    -   Vega-Lite is much simpler for newcomers as it is much more concise and abstracts away a lot of the things that you would normally need to prescribe when using Vega.
    -   Vega does provide a lot more in the way of control over your visualization at the cost of a higher-learning curve.
-   _Render Mode_ specifies whether to use either Vega's SVG renderer or Canvas renderer when compiling, parsing and producing your design.
    -   _Canvas_ renders your design as pixel graphics.
    -   _SVG_ creates your design from vector graphics, results in a number of component elements within the visual to produce the output.
    -   Please refer to the [Performance Considerations](/performance-considerations) page for further details on potential risks and mitigation approaches when it comes to selecting a renderer.
-   _Vega > Power BI Interactivity_ specifies which interactivity features to enable.
    -   As these require some additional setup in your specification, as well as some internal logic to link everything together you are able to specify whether they should be set-up or not.
    -   Only the _Tooltip Handler_ feature is currently supported.
    -   Please refer to the [Interactivity Features](/interactivity-features-overview) and [Tooltips](/interactivity-tooltips) pages for further details on how to configure this for your specification.

## Column and Measure Completion (Specification Editor)

As the specification is text-based, it can be onerous to look-up or type the names for measures or columns in manually. For any that are added to the _Values_ data role, they will be offered (along with a qualifier as to their type) in the _Specification_ editorâ€™s auto-completion, e.g.:

![completer.png](/images/editor/completer.png "Example of a completion for a column within the Specification editor.")
