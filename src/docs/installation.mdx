## AppSource

Deneb is <OutboundLink href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/coacervolimited1596856650797.deneb" target="_blank">available in AppSource</OutboundLink> <!--and is a <OutboundLink href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003712#certified-power-bi-visuals" target="_blank">certified</OutboundLink> custom visual-->. It can be added directly in Power BI as follows:

- To add: in Power BI Desktop, choose _Insert > More visuals > From AppSource_ in the ribbon, e.g.:

  ![appsource-ribbon.png](/images/getting-started/appsource-ribbon.png "The ribbon in Power BI, showing where to obtain additional visuals from AppSource")

  Or by clicking the ellipsis in the _Visualizations_ pane and choose _Get more visuals_, e.g.:

  ![appsource-pane.png](/images/getting-started/appsource-pane.png "The visualizations pane in Power BI, showing where to obtain additional visuals from AppSource")

- In the _Power BI Visuals_ dialog, search for _Deneb_ - a shortlist of visuals will be displayed.

- Click on _Deneb_ in the shortlist to open the visual.

- Click the _Get It Now_ button to ad to your report.

- After a short time, **Deneb** will be visible in your _Visualisations_ pane, e.g.:

## Standalone Version

Because Deneb is pending certification, there are <OutboundLink href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals-certified?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003712#source-code-requirements" target="_blank">certain restrictions</OutboundLink> imposed upon it. If you wish to use features such as loading images from remote URLs, you will need to download the standalone version.

Note that **the standalone version is not tied to AppSource** and will require you to update manually in the event of new versions being published. This can be mitigated by setting it up as an <OutboundLink href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals-organization?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5003712" target="_blank">organizational visual</OutboundLink> if you are using across many reports.

The latest version is published via _Releases_ in <OutboundLink href="https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb" target="_blank">Deneb's GitHub repository</OutboundLink>. The packaged .pbiviz file is available in the _Assets_ section for a particular release.
