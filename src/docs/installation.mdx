Because we're in public preview and it's faster to iterate outside of the AppSource submission and publish process, Deneb is currently only available for download.

It is anticipated that I'll be submitting to AppSource in Q3-Q4 2021, once the version 1.0 roadmap has been fully realized.

**Please be careful when installing custom visuals from unknown or unsolicited sources**. I can assure you that [our intentions are honourable](/privacy-policy) but you should exercise caution around your data. If you have any doubts, then work with your admins to ensure that all the necessary checks and balances are carried out.
