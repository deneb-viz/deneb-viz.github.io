<!--
-   You are applying changes as you type - this will cause frequent re-renders of the visual and a lot of data points can drag this down quite significantly. To mitigate, consider applying your changes manually by using the _Apply_ button or [Ctrl/Command + Enter].
-   You are producing SVG-based visualizations with a large amount of elements. To mitigate, consider sticking to SVG elements that consolidate multiple points into a single element, e.g. lines, or use Canvas rather than SVG to render your specification. -->
