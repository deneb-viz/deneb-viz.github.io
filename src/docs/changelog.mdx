## 0.3.0.8x-beta (2021-mm-yy)

#### Improvements

- Internally, the data view mapping now uses `categorical` rather than `table`, which results in no net change for end-users, but will allow us potentially more functionality with selectors than the `table` data view mapping offers.
- One such benefit is that to date, a report page tooltip could only be created and referenced using a column from the dataset; we can now use a single measure if we so want.

## 0.2.0.82-beta (2021-03-19)

#### Improvements

-   Custom formatter added, which if specified, allows creators to use Power BI format strings instead of D3 ones. Refer to [Formatting Values](/formatting-values) page for details (#13)
-   Keyboard shortcuts now available for all portions of the advanced UI; not just when a user is inside the specification or config editor (#23)
-   Editor pane toggle has keyboard shortcut - `Ctrl + Alt + Space` (#24)
-   Editor tabs now have shortcuts (#2):
    -   Specification - `Ctrl + Alt + 1`
    -   Config - `Ctrl + Alt + 2`
    -   Settings - `Ctrl + Alt + 3`
-   Added switchable locale in dev tools, which will assist with debugging formatting and other i18n stuff (#19)

#### Bugs Fixed

-   Toggling the editor pane lost any changes in-progress. This has been amended to apply changes prior to unmounting the 'expanded' view.
-   Vega templates had incorrect reference to `values` named dataset, rather than `dataset`. These have been re-pointed to be correct.

#### Housekeeping

-   Fixed linting issues with chevron icon in header (#17)
-   Renamed anything to do with editor pane sizing to be more appropriate for the current interface logic (#14)

## 0.1.0.80-beta (2021-03-15)

Initial beta release for early access.
