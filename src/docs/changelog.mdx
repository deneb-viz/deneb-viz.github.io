## 0.3.0 (2021-05-31)

#### Improvements

-   Template import and generation added. This is covered more in the [Templates](/templates) page, but high-level features are as follows:

    -   When editing a specification, there is now a _Generate JSON Template_ button in the editor.
    -   Selecting this presents a dialog that an author can use to customize aspects of the specification, prior to export to (a) provide descriptive detail for anyone wanting to import the template, and (b) make column and measure metadata more suitable for general consumption (particularly if sensitive names are used).
    -   The template JSON is made available for you to review and then copy to the clipboard. This can then be saved as a `.json` file for import by yourself or others.
    -   Additionally, the _Create New Specification_ dialog has an additional _Import from Template_ tab. Here you can import a valid Deneb template (generated using the above functionality) and allocate columns and measures from your _Values_ data role, in the same way as the built-in examples.

-   [INTERNAL] the data view mapping has been swapped from `table` to `categorical`.
    -   This currently results in no net change for end-users, but will potentially allow us more functionality with selectors than the `table` data view mapping offers.
    -   One such benefit is that to date, a report page tooltip could only be created and referenced using a column from the dataset; we can now use a single measure if we so want.

#### Bugs Fixed

-   If overriding the visual `data` within the specification (e.g. when pasting in an example with static data), or adding custom datasets for a particular layer, then Deneb would refuse to render. This has been fixed. (#33)
-   Columns or measures added from the data model containing characters that require special handling, now have these characters replaced in the dataset. Refer to the [documentation regarding this](visual-dataset-binding/#special-characters-in-column-and-measure-names) for further details (#38)

## 0.2.0 (2021-03-19)

#### Improvements

-   Custom formatter added, which if specified, allows creators to use Power BI format strings instead of D3 ones. Refer to [Formatting Values](/formatting-values) page for details (#13)
-   Keyboard shortcuts now available for all portions of the advanced UI; not just when a user is inside the specification or config editor (#23)
-   Editor pane toggle has keyboard shortcut - `Ctrl + Alt + Space` (#24)
-   Editor tabs now have shortcuts (#2):
    -   Specification - `Ctrl + Alt + 1`
    -   Config - `Ctrl + Alt + 2`
    -   Settings - `Ctrl + Alt + 3`
-   Added switchable locale in dev tools, which will assist with debugging formatting and other i18n stuff (#19)

#### Bugs Fixed

-   Toggling the editor pane lost any changes in-progress. This has been amended to apply changes prior to unmounting the 'expanded' view.
-   Vega templates had incorrect reference to `values` named dataset, rather than `dataset`. These have been re-pointed to be correct.

#### Housekeeping

-   Fixed linting issues with chevron icon in header (#17)
-   Renamed anything to do with editor pane sizing to be more appropriate for the current interface logic (#14)
