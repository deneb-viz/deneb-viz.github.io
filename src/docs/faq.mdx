## General

### Why Deneb?

Well, Deneb is the brightest star in Cygnus, and along with Vega and Altair, makes up the astronomical asterism called the Summer Triangle.

If you're a Python developer, be sure to check out <OutboundLink href="https://altair-viz.github.io" target="_blank">Altair</OutboundLink>, which brings the Vega and Vega-Lite tooling into Python.

### How Much Does the Visual Cost?

It's free. <OutboundLink href="https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb-powerbi" target="_blank">And open source</OutboundLink>.

All development, promotion and [support](./support) I do for the visual is carried out in my spare time. If you find the visual useful for your needs, or would like me to be able to spend more time developing and supporting it, <OutboundLink href="https://github.com/sponsors/dm-p" target="_blank">it is possible to sponsor me</OutboundLink>, or <OutboundLink href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dmp" target="_blank">Buy Me A Coffee</OutboundLink> â˜•.
