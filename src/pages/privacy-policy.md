# Deneb Privacy Policy

Deneb and its developers are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This page is used to inform website visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone who chooses to use the Deneb custom visual for Power BI.

## The Deneb Custom Visual

The Deneb custom visual is available for download from either [Microsoft Appsource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) or directly from [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb).

### Data Processing

The custom visual is designed solely for the purpose of visual representation of data. It processes the data provided to it within Power BI to create visualizations. Please note the following:

- **No Data Collection**: The visual does not collect any data from users.

- **No Data Transmission**: The visual does not send any data to external servers or third parties.

### Standalone Version

If the [standalone version](/getting-started#standalone-version) of the visual is downloaded from our GitHub repository, it allows users to access external services such as images and data URLs. However, no data is sent from the visual to any external servers.

## Information Collected by Microsoft

Our Power BI custom visual is available via [Microsoft Appsource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). When you acquire the visual, certain user information is captured by Microsoft. We recommend reviewing Microsoft's [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) for detailed information on their data collection practices.

### Use of Collected Information

The information collected by Microsoft is used by us solely for the purpose of analyzing download metrics. This helps us understand how our custom visual is being used and improve its functionality. Please note the following:

- **No Marketing Use**: We do not use this information for marketing purposes.

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us understand how visitors interact with our site, monitor traffic, and improve our services.

### Anonymized Data Collection

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data is handled in a secure manner. As part of our use of Google Analytics:

- **IP Anonymization**: We anonymize IP addresses as part of our data collection process. This means that your IP address is shortened and cannot be used to identify you personally. This anonymization occurs before your data is sent to Google Analytics.

- **Non-Personally Identifiable Information**: The data collected through Google Analytics is aggregated and anonymous. It is used solely for the purpose of analyzing site traffic and usage patterns. We do not use this data to identify individual visitors.

### Opt-Out
