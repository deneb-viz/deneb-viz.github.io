## Getting Support
Deneb is released under the MIT License, is free of charge, and is open source.

Do you need assistance with a Vega-Lite or Vega specification? Do you require help migrating your specification into Deneb? We have folks in the community that are willing to assist you. **Please keep in mind that these individuals are giving their free time**. Consider the size of your request. If your requirements are significant, consulting may be more appropriate. If unsure whether your inquiry falls under the umbrella of "free assistance," the experts can assess feasibility and determine the level of effort involved.

:::info NOTE
The [_issues_](https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb/issues) area on Deneb's GitHub repository should be reserved for topics involving bugs, testing feedback, or feature requests directly related to Deneb. It is not intended to be a place to request assistance with respect to implementation.

The community experts are listed below. Before reaching out, please execute the steps under the **[How to Get Your Question Answered Fast](#how-to-get-your-question-answered-fast)** section. Next, create a post on your chosen expert's preferred forum detailing your issue. **Be sure to tag them**.

## How to Get Your Question Answered Fast

### Do some research

Before posting in one of the forums listed below, be sure to check and see if someone else has solved a similar issue. Use the search functionality on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), the [Power BI forums](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Power-BI-forums/ct-p/powerbi), the [Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues)/[Vega](https://github.com/vega/vega/) GitHub _issues_ section, etc. There is a high likelihood that a scenario similar to yours has already been resolved.

### Come prepared

When reaching out to one of the community experts, be prepared to clearly describe your objectives. Do you have a specific visualization in mind but encounter difficulties making it work? Outline what you've attempted and describe the desired end state of your implementation. Provide details on any known business rules. If you already have desired [encodings](https://medium.com/@sophiewarnes/whats-visual-encoding-in-data-viz-and-why-is-it-important-7406bc88b4b4) in mind (color, size, proximity, sorting, etc.), communicate them. Be as descriptive as possible. Alternatively, if you prefer a more flexible approach and want the community experts to use their best judgment, let them know.

### Provide

If you have a drafted Vega/Vega-Lite specification, please provide it. Additionally, offer cleansed notional data structured similarly to your actual data. If you possess a .pbix file with data that you are authorized to share, that's even better. [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are just a few options for transferring files and data. Uploading these artifacts upfront significantly aids in receiving swift assistance.

More on providing sample data can be found [here](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Community-Blog/How-to-provide-sample-data-in-the-Power-BI-Forum/ba-p/963216).
