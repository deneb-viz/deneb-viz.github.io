# Support Info

Firstly, thanks very much for using Deneb! I hope that you are able to use it to create some amazing visualizations within Power BI ðŸ˜Š

## Getting Support

Deneb is released under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) and is free or charge and [open source](https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb).

If you have challenges around learning Vega/Vega-Lite or creating a specification to suit your use case then I would suggest to following resources to discuss with other users:

- [Vega discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vega-js)
- [Vega Slack organization](https://bit.ly/join-vega-slack-2020)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)
- [Power BI Community](https://community.powerbi.com/)

I maintain the visual for free, in my free time, so I cannot dedicate this time to providing specific support for the Vega and Vega-Lite languages. However, but if you still experience issues beyond the limitations detailed above or have a particular feature request, [please create an issue in the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb/issues) and I will endeavour to investigate and respond as soon as possible.

If you're still stuck after this and require dedicated support for a particular challenge, [I can be engaged for consultation](/community/contributors#daniel-marsh-patrick) and would be very happy to provide a quotation for any potential work.

## Giving Support

I'm very keen to keep Deneb free and available for all, particularly as the Vega tooling is also open source and freely available. However, all development, promotion and support I do for the visual is carried out in my spare time. If you find the visual useful for your needs, or would like me to be able to spend more time developing and supporting it, [it is possible to sponsor Deneb](https://github.com/sponsors/deneb-viz), or [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dmp) â˜•.
