Most operations in the Visual Editor have corresponding keyboard shortcuts, and a number are mentioned in their corresponding area. However, its always good to see them in one place!

:::info Need A Specific Shortcut?
Please [create an issue in the GitHub repo with what you're missing](https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb/issues) and we'll see if we can get it added :)
