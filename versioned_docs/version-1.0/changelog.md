# Change Log

## 1.0.0 (2021-11-13)

### IMPORTANT NOTES

- This is the promotion of the preview codebase into [the official AppSource release](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/coacervolimited1596856650797.deneb) ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- Fetching via remote URLs (e.g. for image marks) has been disabled to comply with Power BI certification requirements. This can be mitigated by [downloading the standalone build](getting-started#standalone-version).
- There a no major changes in this release; just those that help with QA.

### Bugs Fixed

- Swapping editor position causes editor UI to crash (#137)

### Performance and Stability

- Improved target area of whitespace for clearing an active selection (#140)
- Visual rendering events synced-up with Vega View API (#141)
